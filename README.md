# Solitaire Chess

Solitaire Chess is a single-player logic game designed by Vesa Timonen.
* Your goal is to capture the chess pieces until only one piece remains on the board.
* When there is only one piece left on the board, you win!
* Every move you make must result in a capture.
* Pawns may only move up the board by diagonally capturing another piece.
* Pawns are not promoted when they reach the top rank(top row).
* There is no "check" rule for the King.

## Development
* Using [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and [LÃ¶ve](https://love2d.org/)
* Images(tiles, pieces) must be 90x90 to work well.
* Contributions are welcomed and appreciated
